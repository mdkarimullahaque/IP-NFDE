**Implicit Prior‚ÄìNonlinear Fractional Diffusion Equation and Their Application in Image Processing**

This repository contains the implementation of a hybrid image denoising model that combines **Implicit Prior** and **Nonlinear Fractional Diffusion Equation (NFDE)** to effectively remove noise ‚Äî especially **gamma-distributed speckle noise** ‚Äî from images. The model is particularly suitable for medical imaging (e.g., ultrasound) and remote sensing applications.

## üî¨ Key Features

- Combines PDE-based and deep prior-based techniques
- Supports Deep Image Prior (DIP) and SwinIR priors
- Handles gamma-distributed speckle noise efficiently
- Plug-and-play denoising with visual results

## üöÄ User Test (Google Colab)

You can try out the model directly using the following Colab notebooks:

### üñºÔ∏è Denoise a Pre-noised Image

Click below to open a Colab notebook where you can upload your **noisy image**, and the model will perform denoising:

### üì∑ Denoise a Clean Image After Adding Custom Noise

Click below to upload a **clean image**, choose the noise level (L), and see how the model performs denoising on artificially noised input:

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**

These metrics are automatically computed after denoising and displayed at the end of the notebook.
